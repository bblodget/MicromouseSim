A HTML5 Micromouse simulator
============================

This web app can be used to test Micromouse algorithms in your
web browser.  It exposes a [JavaScript Mouse
API](https://github.com/bblodget/MicromouseSim/wiki/Mouse-API)
for controlling a simulated mouse running in a simulated maze.
You can type your mouse driver code directly in a textbox on the
web page.

There are a large number of mazes to test your mouse algorithm
.  These mazes have been used in Micromouse competitions.  The
source of these mazes are

Known Issues
------------

* Currently there is no way to save the mouse
driver code you type from the application.  So if you want to
save it you should cut and paste it to a file on your local
machine.  
* There is no error checking of the JavaScript mouse driver
code.  If you have errors in your code you many not find out
until the code is running.  If the page freezes up you may have
to reload which may cause you to loose your changes.

This applicaiton is all client side JavaScript.  The best bet
might be to download and run it locally.  This way you can edit
and save your mouse driver code locally.  It is also helpful to
use Firefox's [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) extension for
debugging.

Online Demo
